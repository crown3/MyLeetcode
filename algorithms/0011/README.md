Given *n* non-negative integers *a1*, *a2*, ..., *an *, where each represents a point at coordinate (_i_, *ai*). *n_vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line _i* is at (_i_, *ai*) and (_i_, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

**Note: **You may not slant the container and *n* is at least 2.

The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

**Example:**

```
Input: [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
