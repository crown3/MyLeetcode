title: 76. Minimum Window Substring
sidebarDepth: 0
---

Given a string S and a string T, find the minimum window in S which will contain all the characters in T in complexity O(n).

**Example:**

```
Input: S = "ADOBECODEBANC", T = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"
```

**Note:**

- If there is no such window in S that covers all characters in T, return the empty stringÂ `""`.
- If there is such window, you are guaranteed that there will always be only one unique minimum window in S.
